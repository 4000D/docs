title: Introduction to Maker

## Bitcoin and blockchain technology

Blockchain technology started with Bitcoin, a cryptographically secured, decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin's unique properties made it extremely useful for some types of international and internet-based transactions. However, its experimental nature led to a number of issues, including high price volatility and high cash burn for its proof-of-work-based security mechanism.

The second generation of blockchains, spearheaded by the Ethereum project, focused on unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology by acting as a platform for creating and enforcing *smart contracts* &mdash; software objects that are able to enforce their own rules and directly hold assets, removing the need for traditional legal services.

Smart contracts enable a wide range of new use cases for blockchain technology. One such use case is the *decentralized autonomous organization*, or *DAO* &mdash; an economic organization whose assets, rules, and organizational structure are coded into and managed entirely by smart contracts. As with smart contracts themselves, a DAO can operate without the need for a traditional legal system to enforce its rules. It also provides strong resistance against censorship or external control of the organization by other entities than those who the DAO internally designates as its owners.

In addition to DAOs and many other completely new use cases, smart contracts also greatly expand the capabilities of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and other first-generation projects. Smart contracts enable complex behaviour such as autonomous monetary policy that counteracts volatility, as well as decentralized insurance.

## Introducing Maker

Maker is a DAO based on the Ethereum blockchain, where it maintains the infrastructure for the *dai* &mdash; a cryptocurrency that uses smart-contract-enforced monetary policy to create price stability.

The dai enables Ethereum users to transact with smart contracts and applications on the Ethereum blockchain without having to deal with the volatility that is associated with traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Because it's long-term deflationary, it also functions as a decentralized savings account, resulting in slow and steady capital gains.

Maker is able to maintain this price stability through the Dai Credit System which backs the dai with collateral stored in Ethereum smart contracts, while simultaneously functioning as an internet-based, peer-to-peer credit market that commoditizes credit by allowing anyone with valid collateral to take out loans with low transaction costs and no middleman fees.

The Maker DAO is owned by the people who bought its core token (called MKR) during the development of the system. The MKR token is also a cryptocurrency like the dai, but it does not have price stability &mdash; on the contrary, it is highly speculative and volatile. Its function is to provide collateral insurance to the users of the dai, as well as to regulate the risk of the credit system. Because the entirety of Maker's business logic is fully automated and executed on the Ethereum blockchain, there is no legal entity and the organization doesn't have any representation in the legal world.

## Users of the Dai Credit System

Issuers of the dai are able to use the credit system to borrow money instantly and without any requirements, beyond posting adequate collateral. There are no term limits, and debt positions can opened and covered at any time. This means the dai can service most types of credit demand, including margin trading and business credit.

Holders of the dai, on the other hand, are able to use it as a highly liquid and stable cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain. It can also be used as a low-risk savings asset that's free from volatility risk and is long-term deflationary. The dai has low risk relative to most blockchain assets because every dai is provably backed by a diversified pool of collateral on the Ethereum blockchain, as well as by Maker's insurance fee vault.

Meanwhile, MKR holders gain value from the credit system as a whole because the MKR token represents ownership of Maker's insurance service. All dai issuers pay an insurance fee which is funneled to MKR holders. In return, Maker is forced to bail out any bad debt in the event of a sudden collateral crash (sometimes called a "black swan event"). If Maker does not have enough assets on hand to immediately cover all bad debt, the MKR supply is automatically inflated and sold off to raise funds in order to cover all the bad debt over time. As a result, MKR owners are exposed to both the profits and the risk of Maker's insurance service.
