title: MKR distribution and the MKR fund

## MKR distribution

When Maker is deployed, the total MKR supply will start at 1,000,000 MKR. Prior to this, around 450,000 MKR (45%) has already been distributed to the founders and early investors of the system, in a combination of founders' stake, private sales, as well as public sales.

The remaining undistributed 550,000 MKR is held by the MKR Fund, an entity that controls money on behalf of the Maker DAO.

## The MKR Fund

The MKR fund is controlled by the MKR owners in the same way as the rest of the system, using the same governance mechanisms, and can be thought of as Maker's internal wallet. Members of the community can request money from the fund, and it's up to the MKR holders to vote on whether or not fulfilling a request with money from the fund will be overall profitable for the DAO.

Since the fund is controlled by MKR owners (through voting), the implicit goal of the fund is to maximize the long-term value of MKR by investing in projects and developments that are likely to cause MKR price appreciation.

The most important way in which the fund pursues this goal is to pay salaries (to individuals), recurring payments (to companies), and other expenses during the early development of the system, as well as to prepare a strategy for covering long-term expenses in a sustainable manner once the system is fully developed and its blockchain infrastructure is locked down.
